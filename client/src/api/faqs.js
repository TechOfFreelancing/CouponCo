        q: "What's the difference between a code and a deal?",
        a: "Qwik Savings offers both codes and deals to help you save on your purchases, but there's a slight distinction between the two. A code is a combination of numbers and letters that you copy and paste into a designated box on the store's website during the checkout process. Once successfully applied, you'll witness the discount reflected in your total spend. On the other hand, using a deal is even simpler. No copy-pasting is needed; just click through to the store's website from the offer on QwikSavings.com and proceed with your shopping as usual. As long as your order meets the deal requirements, the discount will be automatically applied at the checkout."

        q: "My coupon code isn’t working, what shall I do?",
        a: "We at Qwik Savings work very hard to ensure all our codes are works, that's why we double-checked our codes before publishing. If you encounter an issue where your code isn't working, there are a few steps to troubleshoot. Firstly, ensure that the products you're purchasing align with the requirements of the code—this could involve specific items or a minimum spending threshold. Double-check that everything in your cart meets these criteria. However, if despite meeting the requirements, the code still doesn't work, we've got you covered. You'll receive a $10 gift card from us as a token of apology for the inconvenience caused. For further details, please visit our 'Our Codes' page."
